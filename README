Final project write up and analysis for Utah State University Structured Population models course taught by Dr. Dave Koons.  Runs analsyses on population datasets reported in Ellis et al. 2012 and available at: http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E093/083/.  Also depends on a raster dataset of global coefficient of variation of precipitation produced by Von Wehrden et al. 2012 and available at: http://esapubs.org/archive/appl/A022/025/
